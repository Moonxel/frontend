Database structure
First, you'll need to create a database to store your web novel content. Here's an example SQL script to create the necessary tables:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE novels (
  id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  synopsis TEXT,
  cover_image VARCHAR(255),
  status ENUM('ongoing', 'completed') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ongoing',
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE chapters (
  id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  novel_id INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  published_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (novel_id) REFERENCES novels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
The novels table stores information about each web novel, including the title, URL slug, synopsis, cover image, status (ongoing or completed), and creation and update timestamps. The chapters table stores the content for each chapter, including the novel ID, title, URL slug, content, publish timestamp, and creation and update timestamps. The novel_id field in the chapters table is a foreign key that references the id field in the novels table.

Novel management
Next, you'll need to create a novel management system to allow authors to create and manage their web novels. This might include:

A dashboard that displays a list of novels, with options to create a new novel or edit an existing novel.
A novel creation form that allows authors to enter the title, synopsis, cover image, and other information about their novel.
An editor for the novel synopsis and cover image.
An editor for each chapter, with options to add, edit, and delete chapters.
